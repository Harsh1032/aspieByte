2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.485
Cloud is a godsend
for data scientists.

3
00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:16.740
Primarily because you're
able to take [the] your data,

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.245
take your information
and put it in the Cloud,

5
00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:21.240
put it in a central
storage system.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.030
It allows you to bypass

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.920
the physical limitations of

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.360
the computers and
the systems you're

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.075
using and it allows you to deploy

10
00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:33.614
the analytics and
storage capacities

11
00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:36.810
of advanced machines that
do not necessarily have to

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.910
be your machine or your
company's machine.

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.400
Cloud allows you not just
to store large amounts of

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.075
data on servers somewhere
in California or in Nevada,

15
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.175
but it also allows you to deploy

16
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:51.680
very advanced computing
algorithms and

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.730
the ability to do

18
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.530
high-performance computing

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.065
using machines that
are not yours.

20
00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:59.760
Think of it as you have

21
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.985
some information,
you can't store it,

22
00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:03.800
so you send it to storage space,

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.135
let's call it Cloud,

24
00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.580
and the algorithms
that you need to use,

25
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.885
you don't have them with you.

26
00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:10.625
But then on the Cloud,

27
00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:13.210
you have those
algorithms available.

28
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.450
So What you do is you deploy
those algorithms on

29
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.565
very large datasets and

30
00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.040
you're able to do it even
though your own systems,

31
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.290
your own machines, your
own computing environments

32
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.270
were not allowing you to do so.

33
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.175
So Cloud is beautiful.

34
00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:29.660
The other thing that Cloud is

35
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.220
beautiful for is that it allows

36
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.660
multiple entities to work

37
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.480
with same data at the same time.

38
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.290
You can be working
with the same data

39
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.730
that your colleagues in say

40
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.470
Germany and another team in India

41
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.390
and another team in Ghana,

42
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.490
they are collectively working and

43
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.530
they're able to do so
because the information,

44
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.970
and the algorithms,
and the tools,

45
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.455
and the answers, and the results,

46
00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:51.245
whatever they needed is
available at a central place,

47
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:53.735
which we call Cloud.
Cloud is beautiful.

48
00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:57.470
Using the Cloud enables you
to get instant access to open

49
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.930
source technologies
like Apache Spark

50
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.975
without the need to install
and configure them locally.

51
00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:04.610
Using the Cloud also gives you

52
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.710
access to the most
up-to-date tools and

53
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.360
libraries without the worry of

54
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.300
maintaining them and ensuring
that they are up to date.

55
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.190
The Cloud is accessible from

56
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.530
everywhere and in
every time zone.

57
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.930
You can use cloud-based
technologies

58
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.850
from your laptop,
from your tablet,

59
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.275
and even from your phone,

60
00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:25.130
enabling collaboration more
easily than ever before.

61
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.320
Multiple collaborators or teams

62
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.690
can access the data
simultaneously,

63
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.435
working together on
producing a solution.

64
00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.990
Some big tech companies
offer Cloud platforms,

65
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.760
allowing you to
become familiar with

66
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.080
cloud-based technologies in
a pre-built environment.

67
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.735
IBM offers the IBM Cloud,

68
00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:47.630
Amazon offers Amazon
Web Services or AWS,

69
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.335
and Google offers
Google Cloud platform.

70
00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:55.280
IBM also provides Skills
Network labs or SN labs

71
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.140
to learners registered at any of

72
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.605
the learning portals on the
IBM Developer Skills Network,

73
00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:02.480
where you have access to tools

74
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.430
like Jupyter Notebooks and Spark

75
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.440
clusters so you can create

76
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.950
your own data science project
and develop solutions.

77
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.365
With practice and familiarity,

78
00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:14.899
you will discover how
the Cloud dramatically

79
00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.840
enhances productivity
for data scientists.

80
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.120
