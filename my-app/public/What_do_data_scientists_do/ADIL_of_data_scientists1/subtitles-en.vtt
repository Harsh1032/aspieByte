2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.880
I've built a recommendation engine before, as part of a large organization and worked

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.150
through all types of engineers and accounted for different parts of the problem.

4
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.810
It's one of the ones I'm most happy with because ultimately,

5
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.580
I came up with a very simple solution that was easy to understand from all levels,

6
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.225
from the executives to the engineers and developers.

7
00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:35.260
Ultimately, it was just as efficient as something really complex,

8
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.820
and they could have spent a lot more time on.

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.313
Back in the university,

10
00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:42.250
we have a problem that we wanted to predict algae blooms.

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.540
This algae blooms could cause a rise in

12
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.655
toxicity of the water and it could cause problems through the water treatment company.

13
00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:56.875
We couldn't like predict with our chemical engineering background.

14
00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:02.463
So we use artificial neural networks to predict when these blooms will reoccur.

15
00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:06.640
So the water treatment companies could better handle this problem.

16
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.360
In Toronto, the public transit is operated by Toronto Transit Commission.

17
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.680
We call them TTC. It's one of

18
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.805
the largest transit authorities in the region, in North America.

19
00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:18.385
And one day they contacted me and said, "We have a problem."

20
00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:19.830
And I said, "Okay, what's the problem?"

21
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.835
They said, "Well, we have complaints data,

22
00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:24.755
and we would like to analyze it, and we need your help."

23
00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:27.265
I said, "Fine I would be very happy to help."

24
00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:29.710
So I said, "How many complaints do you have?"

25
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.790
They said, "A few." I said,

26
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.655
"How many?" Maybe half a million.

27
00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.075
I said, "Well, let's start working with it."

28
00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:37.720
So I got the data and I started analyzing it.

29
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.225
So, basically, they have done a great job of keeping

30
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:44.020
some data in tabular format that was unstructured data.

31
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.485
And in that case, tabular data was when the complaint arrived,

32
00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:50.090
who received it, what was the type of the complaint,

33
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.180
was it resolved, whose fault was it.

34
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.530
And the unstructured part of it was the exchange of e-mails and faxes.

35
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.180
So, imagine looking at

36
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.700
how half a million exchanges of e-mails and trying to get some answers from it.

37
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.175
So I started working with it.

38
00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:07.066
The first thing I wanted to know is why would people complain

39
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:11.455
and is there a pattern or is there some days when there are more complaints than others?

40
00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:14.890
And I had looked at the data and I analyzed it in all different formats,

41
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.340
and I couldn't find [what] the impetus

42
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.720
for complaints being higher on a certain day and lower on others.

43
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.690
And it continued for maybe a month or so.

44
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.800
And then, one day I was getting off the bus in Toronto,

45
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.595
and I was still thinking about it.

46
00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:34.900
And I stepped out without looking on the ground,

47
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.405
and I stepped into a puddle, puddle of water.

48
00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:40.090
And now, I was sort of ankle deep into water,

49
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.950
and it was just one foot wet and the other dry.

50
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.330
And I was extremely annoyed.

51
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.030
And I was walking back and then it hit me,

52
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.325
and I said, "Well, wait a second.

53
00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:50.253
Today it rained unexpectedly,

54
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.430
and I wasn't prepared for it.

55
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.775
That's why I'm wet, and I wasn't looking for it."

56
00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:56.635
What if there was a relationship between

57
00:02:56.635 --> 00:03:00.755
extreme weather and the type of complaints TTC receives?

58
00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:03.160
So I went to the environment Canada's website,

59
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.858
and I got data on rain and precipitation,

60
00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:09.740
wind and the light.

61
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.600
And there, I found something very interesting.

62
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.570
The 10 most excessive days for complaints.

63
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.370
The 10 days where people complain the most were the days when the weather was bad.

64
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.840
It was unexpected rain,

65
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.575
an extreme drop in temperature,

66
00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:27.400
too much snow, very windy day.

67
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.210
So I went back to the TTC's executives and I said,

68
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.730
"I've got good news and bad news."

69
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.015
And the good news is,

70
00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:37.120
I know why people would complain excessively on certain days.

71
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.130
I know the reason for it. The bad news is,

72
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.800
there's nothing you can do about it.

73
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.000
