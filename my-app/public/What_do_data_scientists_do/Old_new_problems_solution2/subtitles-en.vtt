2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.690
Organizations can leverage the almost unlimited
amount of data now available to them in a

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.360
growing number of ways.

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.840
However, all organizations ultimately use
data science for the same reason—to discover

5
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.520
optimum solutions to existing problems.

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.509
Let’s take a look at three examples of data
science providing innovative solutions for

7
00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.270
old problems.

8
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.880
In transport, Uber collects real-time user
data to discover how many drivers are available,

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.010
if more are needed, and if they should allow
a surge charge to attract more drivers.

10
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.090
Uber uses data to put the right number of
drivers in the right place, at the right time,

11
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.780
for a cost the rider is willing to pay.

12
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.460
In a different transport related data science
effort, the Toronto Transportation Commission

13
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.469
has made great strides in solving an old problem
with traffic flows, restructuring those flows

14
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.500
in and around the city.

15
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.580
Using data science tools and analysis, they
have:

16
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.289
Gathered data to better understand streetcar
operations, and identify areas for interventions

17
00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.400
Analyzed customer complaints data,
Used probe data to better understand traffic

18
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.700
performance on main routes and
created a team to better capitalize on big

19
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.399
data for both planning, operations and evaluation

20
00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.640
By focusing on peak hour clearances and identifying
the most congested routes, monthly hours lost

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.560
for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped
from 4.75 hrs. in 2010 to 3 hrs. in mid-2014.

22
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.030
In facing issues in our environment, data
science can also play a proactive role.

23
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.420
Freshwater lakes supply a variety of human
and ecological needs, such as providing drinking

24
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.450
water and producing food.

25
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.520
But lakes across the world are threatened
by increasing incidences of harmful cyanobacterial

26
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.240
blooms.

27
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.090
There are many projects and studies to solve
this long-existing dilemma.

28
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.650
In the US, a team of scientists from research
centers stretching from Maine to South Carolina

29
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.129
is developing and deploying high-tech tools
to explore cyanobacteria in lakes across the

30
00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.560
east coast.

31
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.790
The team is using robotic boats, buoys, and
camera-equipped drones to measure physical,

32
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.549
chemical, and biological data in lakes where
cyanobacteria are detected, collecting large

33
00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.939
volumes of data related to the lakes and the
development of the harmful blooms.

34
00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.250
The project is also building new algorithmic
models to assess the findings.

35
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.620
The information collected will lead to better
predictions of when and where cyanobacterial

36
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.010
blooms take place, enabling proactive approaches
to protect public health in recreational lakes

37
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.019
and in those that supply drinking water.

38
00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.739
Such interdisciplinary training prepares the
next generation of scientists to address societal

39
00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.959
issues with the proper modernized data science
tools.

40
00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.969
It takes gathering a lot of data, cleaning
and preparing it, and then analyzing it to

41
00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.629
gain the insight needed to develop better
solutions for today's enterprises.

42
00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.609
How do you get a better solution that is efficient?

43
00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.269
You must:
Identify the problem and establish a clear

44
00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.030
understanding of it.

45
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.599
Gather the data for analysis.

46
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.069
Identify the right tools to use,

47
00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.049
and develop a data strategy.

48
00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.569
Case studies are also helpful in customizing
a potential solution.

49
00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.930
Once these conditions exist and available
data is extracted, you can develop a machine

50
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.019
learning model.

51
00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.099
It will take time for an organization to refine
best practices for data strategy using data

52
00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.670
science, but the benefits are worth it.

53
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.120
