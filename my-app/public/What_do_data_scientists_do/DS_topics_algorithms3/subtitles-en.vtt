2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.980
I really enjoy regression.

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.380
I'd say regression was maybe one of the
first concepts that I, that really helped

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.380
me understand data so I enjoy
regression.

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.880
I really like data visualization.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.920
I think it's a key element
for people to get across their message to

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.990
people that don't understand that
well what data science is.

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.510
Artificial neural networks.

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:40.860
I'm really passionate about neural networks
because we have a lot to learn with nature

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.190
so when we are trying to mimic our, our brain
I think that we can do some applications with

11
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.330
this behavior with this biological behavior
in algorithms.

12
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.580
Data visualization with R. I love to do this.

13
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.559
Nearest neighbor.

14
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.280
It's the simplest but it just gets the best
results so many more times than some overblown,

15
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.620
overworked algorithm that's just as likely
to overfit as it is to make a good fit.

16
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.939
So structured data is more like tabular data
things that you’re familiar with in Microsoft

17
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.020
Excel format.

18
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.280
You've got rows and columns and that's called
structured data.

19
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.710
Unstructured data is basically data that is
coming from mostly from web where it's not

20
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.840
tabular.

21
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.509
It is not, it's not in rows and columns.

22
00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.509
It's text.

23
00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.380
It's sometimes it's video and audio, so you
would have to deploy more sophisticated algorithms

24
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.630
to extract data.

25
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.899
And in fact, a lot of times we take unstructured
data and spend a great deal of time and effort

26
00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.509
to get some structure out of it and then analyze
it.

27
00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.710
So if you have something which fits nicely
into tables and columns and rows, go ahead.

28
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.789
That's your structured data.

29
00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.299
But if you see if it's a weblog or if you're
trying to get information out of webpages

30
00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.399
and you've got a gazillion web pages, that's
unstructured data that would require a little

31
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.889
bit more effort to get information out of
it.

32
00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:11.039
There are thousands of books written on regression
and millions of lectures delivered on regression.

33
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.510
And I always feel that they don’t do a good
job of explaining regression because they

34
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.069
get into data and models and statistical distributions.

35
00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.180
Let's forget about it.

36
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.180
Let me explain regression in the simplest
possible terms.

37
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.400
If you have ever taken a cab ride, a taxi
ride, you understand regression.

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.910
Here is how it works.

39
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.459
The moment you sit in a cab ride, in a cab,
you see that there's a fixed amount there.

40
00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.940
It says $2.50.

41
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.709
You, rather the cab, moves or you get off.

42
00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.319
This is what you owe to the driver the moment
you step into a cab.

43
00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.319
That's a constant.

44
00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.090
You have to pay that amount if you have stepped
into a cab.

45
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.879
Then as it starts moving for every meter or
hundred meters the fare increases by certain

46
00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:56.879
amount.

47
00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.470
So there's a... there's a fraction, there's
a relationship between distance and the amount

48
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.620
you would pay above and beyond that constant.

49
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.000
And if you're not moving and you're stuck
in traffic, then every additional minute you

50
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.500
have to pay more.

51
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.980
So as the minutes increase, your fare increases.

52
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.180
As the distance increases, your fare increases.

53
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.120
And while all this is happening you've already
paid a base fare which is the constant.

54
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.040
This is what regression is.

55
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.480
Regression tells you what the base fare is
and what is the relationship between time

56
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.400
and the fare you have paid, and the distance
you have traveled and the fare you've paid.

57
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.370
Because in the absence of knowing those relationships,
and just knowing how much people traveled

58
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.890
for and how much they paid, regression allows
you to compute that constant that you didn't

59
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.890
know.

60
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.689
That it was $2.50, and it would compute the relationship
between the fare and and the distance and

61
00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.232
the fare and the time.

62
00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:49.249
That is regression.

63
00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:53.100
