2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.130
Data science and
big data are making

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.275
an undeniable impact
on businesses,

4
00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:16.395
changing day-to-day operations,
financial analytics,

5
00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.930
and especially interactions
with customers.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.015
It's clear that
businesses can gain

7
00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.200
enormous value from

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.390
the insights data
science can provide.

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.910
But sometimes it's hard
to see exactly how.

10
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.070
So let's look at some examples.

11
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.050
In this era of big data,

12
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.485
almost everyone generates
masses of data every day,

13
00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.520
often without being aware of it.

14
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.430
This digital trace reveals

15
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.500
the patterns of our online lives.

16
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.930
If you have ever searched for or

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.195
bought a product on
a site like Amazon,

18
00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:48.740
you'll notice that
it starts making

19
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.145
recommendations related
to your search.

20
00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:52.970
This type of system known as

21
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.350
a recommendation engine is

22
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.645
a common application
of data science.

23
00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.490
Companies like Amazon, Netflix,

24
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.620
and Spotify use
algorithms to make

25
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.720
specific recommendations
derived from

26
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.575
customer preferences and
historical behavior.

27
00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:07.640
Personal assistants like Siri

28
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.770
on Apple devices
use data science to

29
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.780
devise answers to
the infinite number

30
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.260
of questions end users may ask.

31
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.015
Google watches your
every move in the world,

32
00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:18.710
you're online shopping habits,

33
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.195
and your social media.

34
00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:22.400
Then it analyzes that data to

35
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.040
create recommendations
for restaurants, bars,

36
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.500
shops, and other
attractions based on

37
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.550
the data collected from

38
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.980
your device and your
current location.

39
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.325
Wearable devices like
Fitbits, Apple watches,

40
00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:35.840
and Android watches add

41
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.940
information about
your activity levels,

42
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.450
sleep patterns, and heart rate
to the data you generate.

43
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.270
Now that we know how
consumers generate data,

44
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.560
let's take a look at how

45
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.995
data science is
impacting business.

46
00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:50.970
In 2011, McKinsey &
Company said that

47
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.790
data science was going to become

48
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.740
the key basis of competition.

49
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.210
Supporting new waves of

50
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.260
productivity, growth,
and innovation.

51
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.415
In 2013, UPS announced

52
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.045
that it was using data
from customers, drivers,

53
00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:07.715
and vehicles, in a new
route guidance system

54
00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.060
aimed to save time,
money, and fuel.

55
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.640
Initiatives like this support

56
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.200
the statement that data science

57
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.910
will fundamentally change the way

58
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.370
businesses compete and operate.

59
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.835
How does a firm gain a
competitive advantage?

60
00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:25.700
Let's take Netflix as an example.

61
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.370
Netflix collects and analyzes

62
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.965
massive amounts of data
from millions of users,

63
00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:33.170
including which shows
people are watching at

64
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.465
what time a day
when people pause,

65
00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:37.670
rewind, and
fast-forward, and which

66
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.745
shows directors and
actors they search for.

67
00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:42.590
Netflix can be confident that

68
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.870
a show will be a hit
before filming even

69
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.600
begins by analyzing
users preference

70
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.030
for certain directors
and acting talent,

71
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.170
and discovering which
combinations people enjoy.

72
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.995
Add this to the success of

73
00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:58.645
earlier versions of a
show and you have a hit.

74
00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.910
For example, Netflix knew many of

75
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.910
its users had streamed to
the work of David Fincher.

76
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.740
They also knew that
films featuring

77
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.645
Robin Wright had
always done well,

78
00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:09.980
and that the British version of

79
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.685
House of Cards was
very successful.

80
00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:15.500
Netflix knew that significant
numbers of people

81
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.350
who liked Fincher
also liked Wright.

82
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.020
All this information
combined to suggest that

83
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.340
buying the series would be

84
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.200
a good investment
for the company.

85
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.480
They were right.
It was a huge hit.

86
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.310
Thanks to data science,

87
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.310
Netflix knows what people
want before they do.

88
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.000
