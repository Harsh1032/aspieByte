00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.953
At the end of the day, for businesses, they know one thing,

3
00:00:10.953 --> 00:00:15.310
that if they are unable to measure something, they are unable to improve it.

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.578
And if they are unable to measure their costs, they are unable to reduce them.

5
00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:22.008
If they're unable to measure their profits, they are unable to increase them.

6
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:27.068
So the first thing a company has to do is to start recording

7
00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:32.244
information, start capturing data, data about costs.

8
00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:36.011
And the differentiate it by labor costs and material cost,

9
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:40.170
the cost to how much it cost to sell one product and the total cost.

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.090
And then you look at the revenue, where's your revenue coming from?

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.880
Is 80% of your revenue coming from 20% of your customers?

12
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.527
Or is it the other way around?

13
00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:53.320
So first thing first, start capturing data.

14
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.187
Once you have data, then you can apply algorithms and analytics to it.

15
00:00:58.187 --> 00:01:00.130
So the first thing to do would be to capture data.

16
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.630
If you're not capturing it, start capturing it.

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.850
If you're capturing it, archive it.

18
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.060
Do not overwrite on your old data thinking you don't need it anymore.

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.340
Data never gets old.

20
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.900
Data is always relevant, even if it's 100 years old, 200 years old.

21
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.420
It is relevant to you and and your firm and your success.

22
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.250
So keep data, capture it, archive it, make sure nothing goes to waste.

23
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.140
Make sure there's a consistency.

24
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.630
So someone 20 years later trying to understand, that data should be able to do

25
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.170
so, so have proper documentation.

26
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.890
Do it now.

27
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.460
Put the best practices for data archiving in place the moment you start a business.

28
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.510
And if you're already in business and you haven't done it, do it now.

29
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.630
>> Start measuring things.

30
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.440
Too many companies haven't measured things properly for a decade and,

31
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.440
then they decide, they want data science.

32
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.610
Data science inside a company

33
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.860
is only going to be as valuable as the data collected.

34
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.260
Garbage in, garbage out is a rule in any sort of analysis.

35
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.310
>> If something is not measured, it's very difficult to improve it or to change it.

36
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.606
So the very first step is measurement.

37
00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:14.086
If companies have existing data, then they should start looking at it and

38
00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:14.963
cleaning it.

39
00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:17.540
If they don't have existing data, then they need to start collecting it.

40
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.889
>> I think to look for a team who love to work as a data scientist.

41
00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:29.445
>> The first stop is to have employees, that they are interested on data science.

42
00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:34.670
because if you don't have interest in your company, you will not have engagement.

43
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.060
>> Companies should remember, that it's key to have a team.

44
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.743
So it's not one data scientist, but a team of them,

45
00:02:42.743 --> 00:02:47.627
that each of them have strengths in different areas of data science.

46
00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:52.000
