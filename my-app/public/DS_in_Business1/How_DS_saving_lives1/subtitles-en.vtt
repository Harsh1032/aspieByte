2
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.040
Using Data Science techniques to understand
and analyze the large data sets available

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.029
today has a huge impact on human lives.

4
00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.240
It can provide targeted information to help
healthcare professionals give the best treatment

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.650
to patients, or help predict natural disasters
so that people can prepare early, and much

6
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.869
more besides.

7
00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.760
In healthcare, data scientists use predictive
analytics developed from data mining, data

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.930
modeling, statistics, and machine learning
to find the best options for patients.

9
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.960
This type of predictive analytics examines
all known factors for a disease, including

10
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.270
gene markers, associated conditions, and environmental
factors.

11
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.899
It then recommends appropriate tests, suitable
trials, and any suggested treatments.

12
00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.789
Every individual physician has their own store
of knowledge gained from their studies, interests,

13
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.930
and experiences.

14
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.070
Data science systems that use predictive analytics
ensure that all physicians can also access

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.310
the latest information about the disease,
tests, and treatment plans, tailored to their

16
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.050
specific patient.

17
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.140
With this type of system, every physician
has access to the same knowledge, and the

18
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.360
best options can be consistently offered,
improving patient outcomes.

19
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.240
For example, a study by the Boston Consulting
Group and AdvaMedDx, an industry association

20
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.610
of medical diagnostics companies, examined
the barriers to the adoption of potentially

21
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.530
lifesaving diagnostic tests for patients with
a specific cancer and a particular gene marker.

22
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.739
The study discovered that the biggest factor
in the patient being offered a specific test

23
00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.310
was the patientâ€™s oncologist, who may or
may not have known about the test and its

24
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.860
relationship to the gene marker.

25
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.720
By providing extra information through data
science tools, physicians can be made aware

26
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.380
of the most helpful tests and treatments for
a specific patient.

27
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.060
There are many opportunities to explore other
ways to mine data, such as from electronic

28
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.300
medical records for different types of medical
research.

29
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.060
Schools such as the NorthShore University
HealthSystem in suburban Chicago, a leader

30
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.750
in the implementation of Electronic Medical
Records (EMR) systems, now offer guidance

31
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.280
on data mining.

32
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.250
It is the first healthcare provider in America
to be awarded the highest level of EMR deployment

33
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.460
for both inpatient and outpatient care.

34
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.710
This remarkable effort has generated much-anonymized
data available for innovative analytics research.

35
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.070
Developing more sophisticated big data analytics
capabilities helps healthcare organizations

36
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.400
move from basic descriptive analytics towards
predictive insights, thanks to data science.

37
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.420
In the field of Disaster Preparedness, the
ability to save lives using Data Science tools

38
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.390
has been under development for many years.

39
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.930
The use of predictive analytics tools is improving
and providing new data analysis in a multitude

40
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.030
of ways, alerting populations to danger faster
than ever before.

41
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.790
Large, high-quality data sets can be used
to predict the occurrence of numerous types

42
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.840
of natural disasters, which can be the difference
between life and death for thousands of people.

43
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.460
Earthquakes, hurricanes & tornados, floods,
and volcanic eruptions can be predicted with

44
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.770
the help of data science.

45
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.060
Recent research at the University of Warwick
in the UK used social media content such as

46
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.980
photos and keywords to track the development
of floods, hurricanes and other weather events.

47
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.410
When added to the information recorded by
scientists and weather stations, this type

48
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.600
of data can be used to improve the predictions
for localised weather events.

49
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.490
Because the real benefit of this knowledge
is so important, schools are starting to include

50
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.020
this type of data science education in their
curriculum.

51
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.550
For instance, the University of Chicago Graham
School offers a Master of Science course in

52
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.630
Threat and Response Management.

53
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.410
Data science tools enable organizations to
analyse vast quantities of data from widely

54
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.260
different sources, and present that information
in a way that allows data scientists to gain

55
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.100
new knowledge, in some cases, saving hundreds
of lives.
