00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.850
Everyone you ask will give you a slightly
different description of what Data Science

2
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:23.760
is, but most people agree that it has a significant
data analysis component. Data analysis isn't

3
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.860
new. What is new is the vast quantity of data
available from massively varied sources: from

4
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.790
log files, email, social media, sales data,
patient information files, sports performance

5
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.360
data, sensor data, security cameras, and many
more besides. At the same time that there

6
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.570
is more data available than ever, we have
the computing power needed to make a useful

7
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.230
analysis and reveal new knowledge.
Data science can help organizations understand

8
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.699
their environments, analyze existing issues,
and reveal previously hidden opportunities.

9
00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.430
Data scientists use data analysis to add to
the knowledge of the organization by investigating

10
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.369
data, exploring the best way to use it to
provide value to the business.

11
00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.079
So, what is the process of data science? Many
organizations will use data science to focus

12
00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.960
on a specific problem, and so it's essential
to clarify the question that the organization

13
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.490
wants answered. This first and most crucial
step defines how the data science project

14
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.229
progresses. Good data scientists are curious
people who ask questions to clarify the business

15
00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.710
need.
The next questions are: "what data do we need

16
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.549
to solve the problem, and where will that
data come from?". Data scientists can analyze

17
00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.079
structured and unstructured data from many
sources, and depending on the nature of the

18
00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.049
problem, they can choose to analyze the data
in different ways. Using multiple models to

19
00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.570
explore the data reveals patterns and outliers;
sometimes, this will confirm what the organization

20
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.480
suspects, but sometimes it will be completely
new knowledge, leading the organization to

21
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.819
a new approach.
When the data has revealed its insights, the

22
00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.709
role of the data scientist becomes that of
a storyteller, communicating the results to

23
00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.900
the project stakeholders. Data scientists
can use powerful data visualization tools

24
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.680
to help stakeholders understand the nature
of the results, and the recommended action

25
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.750
to take.
Data Science is changing the way we work;

26
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.760
it's changing the way we use data and itâ€™s
changing the way organisations understand

27
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.950
the world.
