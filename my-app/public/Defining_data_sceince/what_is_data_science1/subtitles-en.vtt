00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.670
Data Science is a process, not an event.

2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.125
It is the process of using data to understand different things,

3
00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:16.150
to understand the world.

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.085
For me is when you have a model or hypothesis of a problem,

5
00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:24.180
and you try to validate that hypothesis or model with your data.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.963
Data science is the art of

7
00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:30.090
uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.280
It's when you translate data into a story.

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.045
So use storytelling to generate insight.

10
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:38.550
And with these insights,

11
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.640
you can make strategic choices for a company or an institution.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.400
data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form.

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.270
Data science is the study of data.

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.450
Like biological sciences is a study of biology,

16
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.170
physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions.

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.750
Data is real, data has real properties,

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.345
and we need to study them if we're going to work on them.

19
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:12.420
Data Science involves data and some science.

20
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.020
The definition or the name came up in

21
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.265
the 80s and 90s when some professors were looking into the statistics curriculum,

22
00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:23.340
and they thought it would be better to call it data science.

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.630
But what is Data Science?

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.230
I'd see data science as one's attempt to work with data,

25
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.710
to find answers to questions that they are exploring.

26
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.280
In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science.

27
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.470
If you have data, and you have curiosity,

28
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.550
and you're working with data,

29
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.710
and you're manipulating it, you're exploring it,

30
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.310
the very exercise of going through analyzing data,

31
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.775
trying to get some answers from it is data science.

32
00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:51.200
Data science is relevant today because we have tons of data available.

33
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.440
We used to worry about lack of data.

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.835
Now we have a data deluge.

35
00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:58.950
In the past, we didn't have algorithms, now we have algorithms.

36
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.085
In the past, the software was expensive,

37
00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:02.745
now it's open source and free.

38
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:05.055
In the past, we couldn't store large amounts of data,

39
00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:06.700
now for a fraction of the cost,

40
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.165
we can have gazillions of datasets for a very low cost.

41
00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.710
So, the tools to work with data,

42
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.005
the very availability of data,

43
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.319
and the ability to store and analyze data,

44
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.130
it's all cheap, it's all available,

45
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.070
it's all ubiquitous, it's here.

46
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.320
There's never been a better time to be a data scientist.
