2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.810
My advice to an aspiring data scientist is to be curious,

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.070
extremely argumentative and judgmental.

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.960
Curiosity is absolute must.

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.970
If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.570
Judgmental because if you do not have

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.870
preconceived notions about things you wouldn't know where to begin with.

8
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.675
Argumentative because if you can argument and if you can plead a case,

9
00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:34.910
at least you can start somewhere and then you learn from data and then you

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.690
modify your assumptions and hypotheses and your data would help you learn.

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.805
And you may start at the wrong point.

12
00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:42.635
You may say that I thought I believed this,

13
00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:44.380
but now with data I know this.

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.550
So, this allows you a learning process.

15
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.340
So, curiosity being able to take a position,

16
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.725
strong position, and then moving forward with it.

17
00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:56.615
The other thing that the data scientist [should] would need is

18
00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:02.720
some comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms: some software,

19
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.510
some computing platform, but that's secondary.

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.405
The most important thing is curiosity and the ability to take positions.

21
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.310
Once you have done that, once you've analyzed,

22
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.765
then you've got some answers.

23
00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:18.580
And that's the last thing that a data scientist need,

24
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.660
and that is the ability to tell a story.

25
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.460
That once you have your analytics,

26
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.050
once you have your tabulations,

27
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.641
now you should be able to tell a great story from it.

28
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.685
Because if you don't tell a great story from it,

29
00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:30.385
your findings will remain hidden,

30
00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:32.150
remain buried, nobody would know.

31
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.045
Your rise to prominence is pretty much relying on your ability to tell great stories.

32
00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:42.740
A starting point would be to see what is your competitive advantage.

33
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.395
Do you want to be a data scientist in any field or a specific field?

34
00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.565
Because, let's say you want to be a data scientist and work for

35
00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:53.225
an IT firm or a web-based or Internet based firm,

36
00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:54.810
then you need a different set of skills.

37
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.955
And if you want to be a data scientist, for lets say, in the health industry,

38
00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:00.560
then you need different sets of skills.

39
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.510
So figure out first what you're interested,

40
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.610
and what is your competitive advantage.

41
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.945
Your competitive advantage is not necessarily going to be your analytical skills.

42
00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:13.250
Your competitive advantage is your understanding of some aspect of

43
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.230
life where you exceed beyond others in understanding that.

44
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.225
Maybe it's film, maybe it's retail,

45
00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:23.930
maybe it's health, maybe it's computers.

46
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.570
Once you've figured out where your expertise lies,

47
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.365
then you start acquiring analytical skills.

48
00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.245
What platforms to learn and those platforms,

49
00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:37.050
those tools would be specific to the industry that you're interested in.

50
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.595
And then once you have got some proficiency in the tools,

51
00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:44.135
the next thing would be to apply your skills to real problems,

52
00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:47.640
and then tell the rest of the world what you can do with it.

53
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.127
