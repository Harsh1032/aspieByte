3
00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.630
Data science didn't really
exist when I was growing up.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.010
It's not something that I ever woke up and

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.170
said, I want to be a data
scientist when I grow up.

6
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.250
No, it didn't exist.

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.120
I didn't know I would be
working in data science.

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.190
When I grew up, there isn't
that field called data science.

9
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.630
And I think it's really new.

10
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.863
Data science didn't exist until 2009,
2011.

11
00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:32.360
Someone like DJ Patil or
Andrew Gelman coined the term.

12
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.120
Before that, there was statistics.

13
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.670
And I didn't want to be any of those.

14
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.800
I want to be in business.

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.448
And then I found data science
a heck of a lot more interesting.

16
00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:44.550
I studied statistics,
that's how I started.

17
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.320
I went through many different stages in
my life where I wanted to be a singer and

18
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.440
then a doctor.

19
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.140
And then I realized that
I was good at math.

20
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.890
So I chose an area that was
focused on quantitative analysis.

21
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.660
And from then I do think that
I wanted to work with data.

22
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.720
Not necessarily data science
as it's known today.

23
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.740
The first time that I had
contact with data science,

24
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.010
when I was my first year as
a mechanical engineering.

25
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.550
And strategic consulting firms,
they use data science to make decisions.

26
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.370
So it was my first contact
with data science.

27
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.564
I had a complicated problem
that I needed to solve, and

28
00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:38.280
the usual techniques that we had at
that time couldn't help with that problem.

29
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.860
I graduated with a math degree
in the worst possible time,

30
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.580
right after the economic crisis, and you
actually had to be useful to get a job.

31
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.670
So I went and got a degree in statistics.

32
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.660
And then I worked enough jobs that
were called data scientist that

33
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.040
I suddenly became one.

34
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.820
My undergraduate degree was in
business, and I majored in politics,

35
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.510
philosophy, and economics.

36
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.240
And then I did a masters
in business analytics at

37
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.540
New York University at
the Stern School of Business.

38
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.050
When I left my undergrad,
the first company I joined, it turned out

39
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.320
that they were analyzing electronic point
of sale data for retail manufacturers.

40
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.790
And what we were doing was data science.

41
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.660
But we only really started
using that term much later.

42
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.110
In fact, I'd say four or five years ago is
when we started calling it analytics and

43
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.000
data science.

44
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.230
I had several options for
my internship here in Canada.

45
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.590
And one of the options was
to work with data science.

46
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.160
I used to work with project development.

47
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.050
But I think that was a good choice.

48
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.310
And then I start my
internship with data science.

49
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.420
I'm a civil engineer by training,
so all engineers work with data.

50
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.430
I would say the conventional use of data

51
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.575
science in my life started
with transportation research.

52
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:59.830
I started building large models trying
to forecast traffic on streets, trying

53
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.670
to determine congestion and greenhouse
gas emissions or tailpipe emissions.

54
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.950
So I think that's where my start was.

55
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.860
And I started building these models
when I was a graduate student at

56
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.070
the University of Toronto.

57
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.620
Started working with very large data sets,
looking at household samples of,

58
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.012
say, 150,000 households
from half a million trips.

59
00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:24.160
And that, too,
I'm speaking from mid 90s when this was

60
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.770
supposed to be a very large data set,
but not in today's terms.

61
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.046
But that's how I started.

62
00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:30.840
I continued working with it.

63
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.257
And then I moved to McGill University
where I was a professor of transportation

64
00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:34.950
engineering.

65
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.449
And I built even bigger data models
that involved data and analytics.

66
00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.049
And so I would say, yes, transportation
research brought me to data science.

67
00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:53.049
