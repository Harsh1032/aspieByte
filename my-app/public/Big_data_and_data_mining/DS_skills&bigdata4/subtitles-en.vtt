Music

2
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.240
I'm Norman White, I'm
a Clinical Faculty Member

3
00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:17.933
in the IOMS Department,

4
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.939
Information, Operations
and Management Science

5
00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.965
Department here at Stern.

6
00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:25.819
I've been here for a long time (laughs),

7
00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.815
since I got out of college, pretty much.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.140
I'm sort of a techy, geeky kind of person.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.280
I really like to play with
technology in my spare time.

10
00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:40.519
I'm currently Faculty Director

11
00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.221
of the Stern Center
for Research Computing,

12
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:46.640
in which we have a private cloud

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.418
that runs lots of
different kinds of systems.

14
00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:53.048
Many of our faculty or
PhD students who need

15
00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:57.078
specialized hardware and
software will come to us,

16
00:00:57.078 --> 00:01:00.394
we'll spin up a machine
for them, configure it,

17
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.997
I'll help them and advise on them.

18
00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:06.652
A lot of the data
scientists, or virtually all

19
00:01:06.652 --> 00:01:10.421
the data scientists at
Stern use our facilities.

20
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:13.588
And their PhD students use them a lot.

21
00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:15.880
(music)

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.282
I have an undergraduate
degree in Applied Physics

23
00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:24.766
and while I was an
undergrad I took a number

24
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.979
of economics courses,
so I ended up deciding

25
00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.988
to go to business school, but I had,

26
00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:34.955
this was in the early
days of computers (laughs)

27
00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:38.311
and I had gotten interested in computers.

28
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.320
I came to Stern, which was then
NYU Business School downtown

29
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.200
and they had a little computer center,

30
00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.782
and I decided that I was gonna learn

31
00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:51.091
two things while I was there.

32
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:54.260
One, I was gonna learn how to program.

33
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.313
I had taken one programming
course in college.

34
00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:59.584
And I was gonna learn how to touch type.

35
00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:01.972
I never did learn how
to touch type (laughs).

36
00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:03.523
Or maybe I did but I've forgotten now,

37
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.545
and back to two finger pecking.

38
00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:07.886
But I became a self taught programmer,

39
00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:10.454
and then I took a number of courses at IBM

40
00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:12.976
because I eventually became the director

41
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.833
of the computer center,
while I was getting my PhD

42
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.540
in Economics and Statistics at Stern.

43
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.900
In 1973, the school formed
a department called

44
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.060
Computer Applications
and Information Systems

45
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.712
and I was one of the first faculty members

46
00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:35.879
in the department and I've
been here ever since (laughs).

47
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.879
(music)

48
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.140
My typical Monday is, I usually
get in around 11 o'clock

49
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.700
and I do my email at home first,

50
00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.345
but I come in and I have
two classes on Monday.

51
00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:53.612
I have a class on design and development

52
00:02:53.612 --> 00:02:56.312
of web based systems at six o'clock.

53
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.542
Two o'clock, I have a
dealing with data class.

54
00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:01.720
The class is based on Python notebooks,

55
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.860
so we start with the
basics of Unix and Linux,

56
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.534
just to get the students used to that.

57
00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:14.656
We move onto some Python,
some regular expressions,

58
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.180
a lot of relational
databases, some Python Pandas,

59
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.140
which is sort of like R
for Python, lets you do

60
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.640
mathematical and statistical
calculations in Python.

61
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.333
And then I end up with big data,

62
00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.102
for which, as you probably
know, I'm an evangelist.

63
00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:39.080
The students I have, weekly homeworks.

64
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.180
I put them in teams and they
have to do a big project

65
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:46.348
at the end of the term, and
they do some really cool things.

66
00:03:46.348 --> 00:03:48.348
(music)

67
00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:51.529
Yes, in fact, the whole course

68
00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.218
is taught using Jupyter notebooks.

69
00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:57.826
Every student has their
own virtual machine

70
00:03:57.826 --> 00:04:03.860
on Amazon Web Services, so we
pre configure all the machines

71
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.837
and they get a standard image
that has all of the materials

72
00:04:07.837 --> 00:04:11.969
for the course either loaded
on it or in a Jupyter notebook,

73
00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.899
there are the commands to download it

74
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.280
or update the server
with the right software.

75
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.120
So everybody is in the same environment,

76
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.332
it doesn't matter what kind of,

77
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.099
whether they have a Mac
or a Windows machine

78
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.360
or how old it is, everybody
can do everything in the class.

79
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.300
(upbeat music)
