2
00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:13.790
In this digital world, everyone leaves a trace.

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.250
From our travel habits to our workouts and entertainment, the increasing number of internet

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.730
connected devices that we interact with on a daily basis record vast amounts of data

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.780
about us.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.950
There’s even a name for it: Big Data.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.230
Ernst and Young offers the following definition: “Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.079
disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines.

9
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.090
It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically

10
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.729
process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights

11
00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:55.820
that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder

12
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.499
value.”

13
00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.749
There is no one definition of Big Data, but there are certain elements that are common

14
00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:10.299
across the different definitions, such as velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value.

15
00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.740
These are the V's of Big Data.

16
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.920
Velocity is the speed at which data accumulates.

17
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.390
Data is being generated extremely fast, in a process that never stops.

18
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.549
Near or real-time streaming, local, and cloud-based technologies can process information very

19
00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.939
quickly.

20
00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.820
Volume is the scale of the data, or the increase in the amount of data stored.

21
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.200
Drivers of volume are the increase in data sources, higher resolution sensors, and scalable

22
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.399
infrastructure.

23
00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.579
Variety is the diversity of the data.

24
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.560
Structured data fits neatly into rows and columns, in relational databases while unstructured

25
00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.280
data is not organized in a pre-defined way, like Tweets, blog posts, pictures, numbers,

26
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.690
and video.

27
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.490
Variety also reflects that data comes from different sources, machines, people, and processes,

28
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.510
both internal and external to organizations.

29
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.480
Drivers are mobile technologies, social media, wearable technologies, geo technologies, video,

30
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.080
and many, many more.

31
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.080
Veracity is the quality and origin of data, and its conformity to facts and accuracy.

32
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.490
Attributes include consistency, completeness, integrity, and ambiguity.

33
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.190
Drivers include cost and the need for traceability.

34
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.020
With the large amount of data available, the debate rages on about the accuracy of data

35
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.580
in the digital age.

36
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.400
Is the information real, or is it false?

37
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.290
Value is our ability and need to turn data into value.

38
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.160
Value isn't just profit.

39
00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.710
It may have medical or social benefits, as well as customer, employee, or personal satisfaction.

40
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.870
The main reason that people invest time to understand Big Data is to derive value from

41
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.290
it.

42
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.280
Let's look at some examples of the V's in action.

43
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.480
Velocity: Every 60 seconds, hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube which is generating

44
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480
data.

45
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.950
Think about how quickly data accumulates over hours, days, and years.

46
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.260
Volume: The world population is approximately seven billion people and the vast majority

47
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.050
are now using digital devices; mobile phones, desktop and laptop computers, wearable devices,

48
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.680
and so on.

49
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.680
These devices all generate, capture, and store data -- approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes

50
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.040
every day.

51
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.660
That's the equivalent of 10 million Blu-ray DVD's.

52
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.740
Variety: Let's think about the different types of data; text, pictures, film, sound, health

53
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.870
data from wearable devices, and many different types of data from devices connected to the

54
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.040
Internet of Things.

55
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.230
Veracity: 80% of data is considered to be unstructured and we must devise ways to produce

56
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.670
reliable and accurate insights.

57
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.440
The data must be categorized, analyzed, and visualized.

58
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.780
Data Scientists today derive insights from Big Data and cope with the challenges that

59
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.030
these massive data sets present.

60
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.120
The scale of the data being collected means that it’s not feasible to use conventional

61
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.150
data analysis tools.

62
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.710
However, alternative tools that leverage distributed computing power can overcome this problem.

63
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.280
Tools such as Apache Spark, Hadoop and its ecosystem provide ways to extract, load, analyze,

64
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.130
and process the data across distributed compute resources, providing new insights and knowledge.

65
00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.800
This gives organizations more ways to connect with their customers and enrich the services

66
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.400
they offer.

67
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.290
So next time you strap on your smartwatch, unlock your smartphone, or track your workout,

68
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.760
remember your data is starting a journey that might take it all the way around the world,

69
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.370
through big data analysis, and back to you.

70
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.120
