00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(popping)

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:17.946
Everybody knows how to program,

4
00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:19.349
at least a little bit.

5
00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.710
They all have a little bit
of programming background

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.548
at least, and some of them have a lot.

7
00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:27.210
Some of them are Masters of
Science and Computer Science,

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.761
some of them are MBA
students who've come in

9
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:36.980
from technical fields
and programmed every day.

10
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.180
And others are ones who maybe took

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.253
a programming course in
college four or five years ago

12
00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:45.519
but at least they can
think computationally,

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.440
which I think is the most
important thing that they need.

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.440
(music)

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.391
Data science and business
analytics have become

16
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:01.408
very hot subjects in the
last four or five years.

17
00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:04.614
We have new tools, we have new approaches,

18
00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:08.537
and we have lots and lots
of data that traditional

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.560
techniques just couldn't
really store and handle.

20
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.274
I think the word is out.

21
00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.721
I think at this point, at first,

22
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.378
companies and employers
understood the need,

23
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.420
especially in certain fields.

24
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.640
I can remember talking to a
major bank three years ago

25
00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:30.920
about big data and there was
one little group in the bank

26
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.180
where one person had a little effort

27
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.915
in putting a little cluster together.

28
00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:40.860
Now that same bank has five
or six major big data clusters

29
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.961
and they're putting all of
their credit card data in it

30
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.820
and they're grinding it
upside down and sideways,

31
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.567
using all sorts of data
science kinds of techniques.

32
00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:52.996
Two years ago, or was
it last year, I think,

33
00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:55.138
our undergraduate dealing with data course

34
00:01:55.138 --> 00:01:56.983
had 28 students in it.

35
00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.920
This year it has 140.

36
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.259
So that means that the parents

37
00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.108
are now beginning to get the word,

38
00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:09.149
because one thing we
understand with our undergrads

39
00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.435
is the parents who are
paying very hefty tuitions,

40
00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:16.422
they, you know, they tell
their sons and daughters,

41
00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:19.117
"You know, you should be
an accountant," right?

42
00:02:19.117 --> 00:02:21.523
Or, "You should go into
financial services,

43
00:02:21.523 --> 00:02:24.328
"or into marketing, 'cause
this is where the money is."

44
00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:27.016
Now, they're getting the word that

45
00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:31.176
maybe you should take some more
STEM classes in high school

46
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.340
and be ready to go into data science

47
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.580
or go into fields where analytics

48
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.340
has become more and more important.

49
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.340
(music)

50
00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:51.413
It depends on who you are (laughs).

51
00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:53.866
I have my own definition of big data.

52
00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:57.959
My definition of big data
is data that is large enough

53
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.120
and has enough volume and velocity

54
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.460
that you cannot handle it with
traditional database systems.

55
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.440
Some of our statisticians think big data

56
00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:14.422
is something you can't
fit on a thumb drive.

57
00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:19.240
Big data, to me, was started by Google.

58
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.200
When Google tried to
figure out how they were,

59
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.340
when Larry Page and Sergey
Brin wanted to, basically,

60
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.800
figure out how to solve
their page rank algorithm,

61
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.780
there was nothing out there.

62
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.340
They were trying to store all
of the web pages in the world,

63
00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:42.216
and there was no technology,
there was no way to do this,

64
00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:44.928
and so they went out and
developed this approach,

65
00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:48.355
which has now become,
Hadoop has copied it,

66
00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:50.916
but this is where all these large,

67
00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:53.103
big data clusters are found.

68
00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:56.432
But big data has now also expanded into,

69
00:03:56.432 --> 00:03:57.851
how do you analyze?

70
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.320
There are new analytical techniques

71
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.012
and statistical techniques
for handling these

72
00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:05.553
really, really, really large data sets.

73
00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:07.953
We'll probably get to deep learning

74
00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:09.694
at some point along here.

75
00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:12.694
