00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
Music

2
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.840
Traditionally in computation
and processing data

3
00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:23.772
we would bring the data to the computer.

4
00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:25.001
You'd wanna program

5
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.767
and you'd bring the data into the program.

6
00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.755
In a big data cluster

7
00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:32.256
what Larry Page and Sergey Brin

8
00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:35.304
came up with is very pretty simple

9
00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:37.766
is they took the data and they sliced it

10
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.260
into pieces and they distributed each

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.320
and they replicated each piece

12
00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:43.740
or triplicated each piece

13
00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:45.939
and they would send it

14
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.363
the pieces of these files

15
00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:50.983
to thousands of computers

16
00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.078
first it was hundreds but
then now it's thousands

17
00:00:53.078 --> 00:00:54.759
now it's tens of thousands.

18
00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.747
And then they would send the same program

19
00:00:57.747 --> 00:01:00.854
to all these computers in the cluster.

20
00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:03.251
And each computer would run the program

21
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:05.993
on its little piece of the file

22
00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:08.196
and send the results back.

23
00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:09.921
The results would then be sorted

24
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:13.034
and those results would
then be redistributed

25
00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:15.799
back to another process.

26
00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.251
The first process is called
a map or a mapper process

27
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:21.946
and the second one was
called a reduce process.

28
00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:23.768
Fairly simple concepts

29
00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:25.770
but turned out that you could do

30
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.316
lots and lots of different kinds of

31
00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:31.515
handle lots and lots of
different kinds of problems

32
00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.452
and very, very, very large data sets.

33
00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:38.043
So the one thing that's nice
about these big data clusters

34
00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.264
is they scale linearly.

35
00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:42.041
You had twice as many servers

36
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:43.694
and you get twice the performance

37
00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:45.905
and you can handle twice
the amount of data.

38
00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.867
So this was just broke a bottleneck

39
00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:51.967
for all the major social media companies.

40
00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.251
Yahoo then got on board.

41
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:57.388
Yahoo hired someone named Doug Cutting

42
00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:59.701
who had been working

43
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.890
on a clone or a copy

44
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.060
of the Google big data architecture

45
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.750
and now that's called Hadoop.

46
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.502
And if you google Hadoop you'll see that

47
00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:12.593
it's now a very popular term

48
00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:14.385
and there are many, many, many

49
00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:17.637
if you look at the big data ecology

50
00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:21.183
there are hundreds of thousands
of companies out there

51
00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:23.402
that have some kind of footprint

52
00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:25.235
in the big data world.

53
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240
(music)

54
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.480
Most of the components of data
science have been around for

55
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.860
many, many, many, many decades.

56
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.110
But they're all coming together now

57
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.940
with some new nuances I guess.

58
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.520
At the bottom of data science

59
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.469
you see probability and statistics.

60
00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.992
You see algebra, linear algebra

61
00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:52.879
you see programming

62
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.667
and you see databases.

63
00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:57.243
They've all been here.

64
00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.756
But what's happened now is we

65
00:02:59.756 --> 00:03:02.873
now have the computational capabilities

66
00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:06.011
to apply some new techniques
- machine learning.

67
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.865
Where now we can take really large data sets

68
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:11.152
and instead of taking a sample

69
00:03:11.152 --> 00:03:14.539
and trying to test some hypothesis

70
00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.017
we can take really, really large data sets

71
00:03:17.017 --> 00:03:19.236
and look for patterns.

72
00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:23.785
And so back off one level
from hypothesis testing

73
00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:28.761
to finding patterns that maybe
will generate hypotheses.

74
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:32.779
Now this can bother some very
traditional statisticians

75
00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.931
and gets them really annoyed sometimes

76
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:36.962
that you know you're
supposed to have a hypothesis

77
00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:39.752
that is not that is
independent of the data

78
00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:40.753
and then you test it.

79
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.940
So once some of these machine
learning techniques started

80
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.860
were really the only thing

81
00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:49.472
the only way you can analyze

82
00:03:49.472 --> 00:03:51.368
some of these really large

83
00:03:51.368 --> 00:03:54.600
social media data sets.

84
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.180
So what we've seen is that the combination

85
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.240
of traditional [technique] areas computer science

86
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.178
probability, statistics, mathematics

87
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.320
all coming together in
this thing that we call

88
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.977
Decision Sciences.

89
00:04:13.977 --> 00:04:15.215
Our department at Stern

90
00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:16.740
I'll give a little plug here

91
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.068
we happen to have been very well situated

92
00:04:20.068 --> 00:04:21.452
among business schools

93
00:04:21.452 --> 00:04:23.535
because we're one of
the few business schools

94
00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:26.501
that has a real statistics department

95
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.706
with real PhD level statisticians in it.

96
00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:31.237
We have an operations
management department

97
00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.874
and an information systems department.

98
00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.841
So we have a wide range
of computer scientists

99
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:40.604
to statisticians, to
operations researchers.

100
00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:43.631
And so we were like perfectly positioned

101
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:46.805
as a couple of other business schools were

102
00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:49.689
to jump on this bandwagon and say; okay

103
00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.020
this is Decision Sciences.

104
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.935
And Foster Provost who's
in my department was

105
00:04:55.935 --> 00:05:00.102
the first director of the
NYU Center for Data Science.

106
00:05:00.102 --> 00:05:02.102
(music)

107
00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:06.331
Four years ago maybe five years ago.

108
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:08.572
I mean, I feel this is one of those cases

109
00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:09.919
where you can just to Google

110
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.420
and search for

111
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.720
data science and see how often it occurred

112
00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:17.652
and you'll see almost nothing

113
00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:19.483
and then just a spike.

114
00:05:19.483 --> 00:05:21.388
The same thing you would see with big data

115
00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.980
about seven or eight years ago.

116
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.013
So data science is a
term I haven't heard of

117
00:05:27.013 --> 00:05:29.013
probably five years ago.

118
00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:31.013
(music)

119
00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:35.979
The first question is what is it?

120
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.760
And I think

121
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.637
faculty and everybody is still trying to

122
00:05:41.637 --> 00:05:44.991
get their hands around exactly what is

123
00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:47.981
business analytics and
what is data science.

124
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:49.644
We certainly know

125
00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:53.640
the components of it.

126
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.400
But it's morphing and
changing and growing.

127
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.980
I mean the last three years

128
00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:02.886
deep learning has just
been added into the mix.

129
00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:08.040
Neural networks have been
around for 20 or 30 years.

130
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.792
20 years ago, I would teach
neural networks in a class

131
00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:16.235
and you really couldn't
do very much with them.

132
00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:18.931
And now some researchers have come up with

133
00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:20.907
multi-layer neural networks

134
00:06:20.907 --> 00:06:24.680
in Toronto in particular
the University of Toronto.

135
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.037
And that technology is
now rapidly expanding

136
00:06:29.037 --> 00:06:33.204
it's being used by Google, by
Facebook, by lots of companies.

137
00:06:33.204 --> 00:06:36.204
(music)
