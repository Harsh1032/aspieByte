2
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.330
Digital Transformation affects business operations,
updating existing processes and operations

3
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.900
and creating new ones to harness the benefits
of new technologies.

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.410
This digital change integrates digital technology
into all areas of an organization resulting

5
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.410
in fundamental changes to how it operates
and delivers value to customers.

6
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.340
It is an organizational and cultural change
driven by Data Science, and especially Big

7
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.210
Data.

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.790
The availability of vast amounts of data,
and the competitive advantage that analyzing

9
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.830
it brings, has triggered digital transformations
throughout many industries.

10
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.399
Netflix moved from being a postal DVD lending
system to one of the world’s foremost video

11
00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.720
streaming providers, the Houston Rockets NBA
team used data gathered by overhead cameras

12
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.189
to analyze the most productive plays, and
Lufthansa analyzed customer data to improve

13
00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.400
its service.

14
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.420
Organizations all around us are changing to
their very core.

15
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.170
Let’s take a look at an example, to see
how Big Data can trigger a digital transformation,

16
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.219
not just in one organization, but in an entire
industry.

17
00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:28.840
In 2018, the Houston Rockets, a National Basketball
Association, or NBA team, raised their game

18
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.529
using Big Data.

19
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:35.929
The Rockets were one of four NBA teams to
install a video tracking system which mined

20
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.759
raw data from games.

21
00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.259
They analyzed video tracking data to investigate
which plays provided the best opportunities

22
00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.599
for high scores, and discovered something
surprising.

23
00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:52.549
Data analysis revealed that the shots that
provide the best opportunities for high scores

24
00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.349
are two-point dunks from inside the two-point
zone, and three-point shots from outside the

25
00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.540
three-point line, not long-range two-point
shots from inside it.

26
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.369
This discovery entirely changed the way the
team approached each game, increasing the

27
00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.180
number of three-point shots attempted.

28
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.160
In the 2017-18 season, the Rockets made more
three-point shots than any other team in NBA

29
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.210
history, and this was a major reason they
won more games than any of their rivals.

30
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.250
In basketball, Big Data changed the way teams
try to win, transforming the approach to the

31
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.360
game.

32
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.340
Digital transformation is not simply duplicating
existing processes in digital form; the in-depth

33
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.230
analysis of how the business operates helps
organizations discover how to improve their

34
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.250
processes and operations, and harness the
benefits of integrating data science into

35
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.980
their workflows.

36
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.310
Most organizations realize that digital transformation
will require fundamental changes to their

37
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.610
approach towards data, employees, and customers,
and it will affect their organizational culture.

38
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.650
Digital transformation impacts every aspect
of the organization, so it is handled by decision

39
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.660
makers at the very top levels to ensure success.

40
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.680
The support of the Chief Executive Officer
is crucial to the digital transformation process,

41
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.880
as is the support of the Chief Information
Officer, and the emerging role of Chief Data

42
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.210
Officer.

43
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.260
But they also require support from the executives
who control budgets, personnel decisions,

44
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.540
and day-to-day priorities.

45
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.260
This is a whole organization process.

46
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.670
Everyone must support it for it to succeed.

47
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.410
There is no doubt dealing with all the issues
that arise in this effort requires a new mindset,

48
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.620
but Digital Transformation is the way to succeed
now and in the future.
