00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.354
A real data scientist, the
high-end data scientists,

3
00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:21.306
are mostly PhDs.

4
00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:24.932
They often come out of
physics, out of statistics,

5
00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:28.429
they have to have a computer
science background,

6
00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.214
they have to have a math background,

7
00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:33.908
they have to know about
databases and statistics

8
00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.550
and probability and all that stuff.

9
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.221
However, if you're coming
into a data science team,

10
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:44.021
I think the first skills
you need is you need

11
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:46.325
to know how to program,

12
00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:51.140
at least have some computational thinking,

13
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.476
so having taken a programing course,

14
00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:57.160
you need to know some algebra,
at least up to analytics,

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.040
geometry, and hopefully some calculus,

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.600
some basic probability,
some basic statistics,

17
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.804
I mean really have to
understand the difference

18
00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:10.960
and different statistical
distributions, and database.

19
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.200
I mean, one of the easiest places to start

20
00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:17.052
is relational databases,
which stores lots and lots

21
00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:21.075
of our data so people can
first walk before they can run

22
00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:25.066
by at least understanding
about computers and databases

23
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.639
and how we store things
and if you understand

24
00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.868
relational databases
nowadays you can still,

25
00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:36.120
just with that understanding,
use big data clusters

26
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.660
as if they were just a
big relational database.

27
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.414
You don't have to really have
understand the whole

28
00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:42.380
MapReduce programming model.

29
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.933
But then, as you go
further up in the field,

30
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:49.577
then you have to know a lot
of computer science theory

31
00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:52.494
and statistics, it's
really, and probability,

32
00:01:52.494 --> 00:01:55.388
it's really the intersection of them

33
00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:58.091
that the high end data scientists,

34
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:01.473
the PhD data scientists work with.

35
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.900
(music)

36
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.635
I do a lot of self-learning.

37
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.680
I think everybody these days,

38
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.480
I mean, I learned about
Hadoop all by myself,

39
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.990
I read some articles,
I watched some videos,

40
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.600
I thought, I played,
although I'm a builder,

41
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.060
I'm a tinkerer, so if I wanna figure out

42
00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:26.457
how to do something, I build it.

43
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.100
I mean, my first HPC cluster

44
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.840
I heard about this term a Beowulf cluster,

45
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.700
I mean, yeah, what the hell's that?

46
00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:39.446
So I looked it up and said, oh,

47
00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:41.208
it's just a bunch of
computers hooked together

48
00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:44.429
with a TCP/IP network, that's pretty easy,

49
00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.241
so we get a grant from Citi Bank

50
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:50.644
and we built a five
thing cluster and I said,

51
00:02:50.644 --> 00:02:52.109
oh, well, that's HPC.

52
00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.688
I said, I had one of
the first HPC clusters

53
00:02:54.688 --> 00:02:58.038
at the university, it
was tiny but a lot of our

54
00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:00.744
researchers loved it
because they could run stuff

55
00:03:00.744 --> 00:03:02.800
40 and 50 times faster.

56
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.176
So I think one of the ways you
learn things is you do them,

57
00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:10.697
you have to do them, and these
online learning platforms

58
00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:13.680
especially now that we
have things like IPython

59
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.914
and Jupyter Notebooks and I guess Zeppelin

60
00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:19.210
means that you can actually go in

61
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.544
and take some of these courses

62
00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:23.884
and you can do things right then

63
00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:27.380
and you can see them and
feel them and play with them

64
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.363
and, at that point, you know,
you'll start to get your

65
00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:33.358
head around what is actually happening.

66
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.760
Motivation is the key
problem in all of these,

67
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.531
is how to keep people motivated

68
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.940
and I think the badge system
that the, what was it,

69
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.340
Big Data University
has, is one of the ways

70
00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.186
is how do you get people
to keep going through.

71
00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:56.180
But if they want to, they can.

72
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.915
It's up to the individual to.

73
00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:01.669
So they have to understand
what the goal is.

74
00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.080
(music)

75
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.475
The place it can't sit

76
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.000
is probably under the CIO,
the Chief Information Officer.

77
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.240
CIOs current chief information
officers in many companies

78
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.657
got there from an accounting background

79
00:04:20.657 --> 00:04:23.421
or a finance background, they're clueless.

80
00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:24.254
Sorry.

81
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.920
But they really, it has to
come out of the research side.

82
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.860
So you'll find data scientists
primarily in companies

83
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.280
that have some research
agenda, pharmaceuticals,

84
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.020
finance, all of, any technology company.

85
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.360
If you look at, we can't keep some of our

86
00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:52.777
PhD data scientists in our program,

87
00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:54.513
they are now at Facebook,

88
00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:57.758
they're at Linkedin, they're
at Uber, they're at Lyft,

89
00:04:57.758 --> 00:05:00.586
because the demand out
there for the PhD level

90
00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:03.438
data scientist is just unbelievable.

91
00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:05.180
They make large amounts of money

92
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.138
and they're playing with problems

93
00:05:07.138 --> 00:05:09.748
that are really, really neat.

94
00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:13.400
How do you schedule the Uber cars?

95
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.232
You have enormous amounts of data.

96
00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.000
