00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.043
The emergence of Internet of things and
advances in distributed computing

3
00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:15.552
have brought vast amounts of data and the
technological capability to analyze it.

4
00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:20.328
Now that we can extract useful insights
and new knowledge, we need to know how to

5
00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:24.411
shape that data to focus on what to
do with it and what it can do for us.

6
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:26.332
Enter data science.

7
00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:29.964
Companies like LinkedIn,
Glassdoor, Indeed, and

8
00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:34.807
Dice track employment trends which
show a career in data science moving

9
00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:39.668
up the list of most promising jobs
to become number one since 2016.

10
00:00:39.668 --> 00:00:44.170
It remains one of the top
three career choices for 2020.

11
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.682
Dice noted that job postings are from
companies in a wide variety of industries,

12
00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:50.743
not just tech.

13
00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:55.835
Global Industry Analysts Incorporated
predicts that the data

14
00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:00.829
science platform market will
grow by $314.8 billion US

15
00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.740
by 2025,
driven by a compounded growth of 38.2%.

16
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.544
McKinsey Global Institute warned
of huge talent shortages for

17
00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:13.086
data and analytics by 2018.

18
00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:16.808
Forrester Research Analyst Brandon Purcell
said,

19
00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:21.798
in January of 2019, the demand for
data scientists will only grow

20
00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:26.467
as organizations increasingly
rely on data-driven insights.

21
00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:30.574
We're now well into that period, and
recruiters are finding it difficult to

22
00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:34.020
fill the growing need for
talented data scientists.

23
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.496
What motivates someone
going into a data science?

24
00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:41.690
For one thing, data science
applies to almost any discipline.

25
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.660
So if you have the aptitude and
desire to work with data, enjoy coding,

26
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.750
have no problem learning math and
statistics, and you are a good

27
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.340
storyteller, then you can certainly
enter a data science field and excel.

28
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.767
For most people,
this means acquiring additional tools and

29
00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:02.284
skills and continuously learning about
new tools and techniques in the field.

30
00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:07.272
The women in data science initiative
spearheaded by the Stanford Institute for

31
00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:12.409
Computational and Mathematical Computing
have committed to inspire and educate

32
00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.783
data scientists worldwide, regardless of
gender and to support women in the field.

33
00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:20.250
When you are seeking
a career in data science,

34
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.061
you need to make sure your skill set
matches the role you are targeting.

35
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:28.207
You can tailor your skill set to
the specific area you want to enter,

36
00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:33.171
adding missing skills via one of the many
excellent online training resources.

37
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:37.260
Then you'll be prepared for
a fascinating and rewarding career.

38
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.594
So now it is time to move into
this field, when there are such
