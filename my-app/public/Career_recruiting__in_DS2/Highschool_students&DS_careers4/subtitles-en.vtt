00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.070
(Music)

2
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.590
Learn how to program.

3
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.570
Learn some math.

4
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.170
Take a course in probability.

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.470
Learn a little bit of statistics.

6
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.560
And then, play.

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.310
Build something, write something.

8
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.280
I mean, when I say build, programming and
building systems, building things isn't just

9
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.969
physical, right?

10
00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.480
You can build computer systems, statistical
systems, whatever.

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.320
But once you try to do something, then you'll
know what tools you need, right?

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.820
And you'll say, "Oh, oh my god, what?

13
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.899
"There's this expression there, "what does
an inner product mean?

14
00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:55.899
"What's that?

15
00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.440
"How do I, oh, okay, I can learn that."

16
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.780
And then when they get to college, they will
have a big jump on many of the other college

17
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.930
students.

18
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.580
And so when they get out of college, they'll
have an even bigger jump, and then make a

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.580
lot of money.

20
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.860
And they'll be happy, too.

21
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.880
This stuff is fun, right?

22
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.200
It's fun.

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.320
If you're in high school and you're considering
data science, I would say get familiar with

24
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.490
data bases, start learning SQL, start thinking
about, you know, computer science, if that's

25
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.490
interesting.

26
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.070
If you have a computer science course in your
school, you know, take it, and that's a good

27
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.420
part of being a data scientist.

28
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.939
Beyond that there are probably ways to foster
your creativity, right, your curiosity.

29
00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.750
If you like detective games, that's kind of
cool, right.

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.940
And if you like treasure hunts or whatever,
right, if you're into that stuff, I think

31
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.299
you'll, and you get the opportunity to do
that stuff, that will help you as a data scientist

32
00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.719
because it's a really a good way to kind of
make sure that you can be curious as you go

33
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.840
about your daily life.

34
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.620
(Music)

35
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.820
Encourage the curiosity, encourage the experimentation.

36
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.360
It's kind of like science fairs, science fairs
are great, they encourage that experimentation,

37
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.269
that learning from, asking a question and
answering it through a scientific method,

38
00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:36.109
but doing that with data sets rather than
vinegar volcanoes.

39
00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.610
It's kind of the same thing, but learning
from data and we're going through an election

40
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.970
season right now, there's a lot of stuff in
the news about polls and survey results and

41
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.390
that's a great way to start a conversation
and talk about how do the people who ran the

42
00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.170
polls, how do they know, how can they predict
what's going to happen in the election.

43
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.450
So that's another cool way to start a conversation
about data science.

44
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.450
(Music)

45
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.660
I would say encourage the person who is interested
in data science because to pursue to, because

46
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.700
it's a great career and it is something that
is definitely going to be in need in the future.

47
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:34.470
It's one of those highly sought after knowledge
professions that are really important to businesses

48
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.120
around the world.

49
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.540
So being a data scientist and being able to
help companies as they grow and learn how

50
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.130
do to things more efficiently or how to do
things smarter, there will always be a need

51
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.540
for people like that.

52
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.590
And data scientists are those people.

53
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.590
(Music)

54
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.130
I would say that I understand what you're
talking about because

55
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.970
I was never a great mathematics student as
well.

56
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.910
And I think there's actually a bunch of data
scientist, who are really successful and popular,

57
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.030
who are in the same boat.

58
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.000
You know there's kind of arithmetic and math
in school is not necessarily everybody's best

59
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.470
subject.

60
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.030
But when you combine it with, you know these
aren't just hypothetical numbers, these aren't

61
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.450
just, problem statements that you
have no connection to.

62
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.790
When you have a connection to the problem,
it suddenly becomes much easier to use math

63
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.470
to help understand it, I found.

64
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.030
And so you know, knowing the people who will
benefit from the math that you do I think

65
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.660
is really cool.

66
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.000
