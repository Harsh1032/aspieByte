00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.000
In data science, there are

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.070
many terms that are
used interchangeably,

3
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.305
so let's explore the
most common ones.

4
00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.270
The term big data refers to

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.105
data sets that are so
massive, so quickly built,

6
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:22.860
and so varied that they defy

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.140
traditional analysis methods such

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.210
as you might perform with
a relational database.

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.220
The concurrent development
of enormous compute power in

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.160
distributed networks and
new tools and techniques

11
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.090
for data analysis means
that organizations

12
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
now have the power to analyze
these vast data sets.

13
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.380
A new knowledge and

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.720
insights are becoming
available to everyone.

15
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.380
Big data is often described
in terms of five V's;

16
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.900
velocity, volume, variety,
veracity, and value.

17
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.505
Data mining is the process of

18
00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:58.070
automatically searching
and analyzing data,

19
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.830
discovering previously
unrevealed patterns.

20
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.440
It involves preprocessing
the data to

21
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.970
prepare it and transforming

22
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.815
it into an appropriate format.

23
00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.165
Once this is done,

24
00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:10.100
insights and patterns
are mined and

25
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.710
extracted using various
tools and techniques

26
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.290
ranging from simple data
visualization tools

27
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.275
to machine learning and
statistical models.

28
00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.410
Machine learning is
a subset of AI that

29
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.020
uses computer algorithms
to analyze data

30
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.480
and make intelligent
decisions based on what it is

31
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.570
learned without being
explicitly programmed.

32
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.030
Machine learning algorithms
are trained with

33
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.015
large sets of data and
they learn from examples.

34
00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:37.990
They do not follow
rules-based algorithms.

35
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.770
Machine learning is what

36
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.020
enables machines to
solve problems on

37
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.149
their own and make
accurate predictions

38
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.255
using the provided data.

39
00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.950
Deep learning is a
specialized subset

40
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.120
of machine learning that

41
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.084
uses layered neural networks

42
00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:54.425
to simulate human
decision-making.

43
00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:56.750
Deep learning algorithms
can label and

44
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.930
categorize information
and identify patterns.

45
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.480
It is what enables AI systems to

46
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
continuously learn on
the job and improve

47
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.590
the quality and accuracy of

48
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.489
results by determining whether
decisions were correct.

49
00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.130
Artificial neural networks, often

50
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.529
referred to simply
as neural networks,

51
00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.515
take inspiration from
biological neural networks,

52
00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:20.780
although they work quite
a bit differently.

53
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.760
A neural network in AI is

54
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.190
a collection of small
computing units called

55
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.470
neurons that take incoming data

56
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.810
and learn to make
decisions over time.

57
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.290
Neural networks are often
layer-deep and are the reason

58
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.150
deep learning
algorithms become more

59
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.865
efficient as the data
sets increase in volume,

60
00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:40.265
as opposed to other machine
learning algorithms

61
00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:43.160
that may plateau
as data increases.

62
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.650
Now that you have a
broad understanding of

63
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.740
the differences between
some key AI concepts,

64
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.680
there is one more differentiation
that is important to

65
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.585
understand that between

66
00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:56.455
Artificial Intelligence
and Data Science.

67
00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:59.929
Data Science is the process
and method for extracting

68
00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.400
knowledge and insights from

69
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.760
large volumes of disparate data.

70
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.175
It's an interdisciplinary
field involving mathematics,

71
00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:10.070
statistical analysis,
data visualization,

72
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.915
machine learning, and more.

73
00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:14.240
It's what makes it
possible for us to

74
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.865
appropriate information,
see patterns,

75
00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:18.860
find meaning from
large volumes of

76
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.675
data and use it to make
decisions that drive business.

77
00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:25.040
Data Science can use many of

78
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.400
the AI techniques to
derive insight from data.

79
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.375
For example, it could use
machine learning algorithms and

80
00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.580
even deep learning
models to extract

81
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.565
meaning and draw
inferences from data.

82
00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:41.720
There is some interaction
between AI and Data Science,

83
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.210
but one is not a
subset of the other.

84
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.900
Rather, Data Science is a
broad term that encompasses

85
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.055
the entire data processing
methodology while AI includes

86
00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.575
everything that allows
computers to learn how to

87
00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:57.635
solve problems and make
intelligent decisions.

88
00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:02.210
Both AI and Data Science can
involve the use of big data.

89
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.210
That is, significantly
large volumes of data.
